# Connect 4 Game

Connect 4 against a computer from Easy to Expert, on one device between two
people, or between two devices on the same network. Every game has a seed that
can be copied and played again, unlimited undo, an instant replay at the end,
and a leaderboard for wins.

Live at <https://connect4.uwuapps.org>. A PWA: once opened, it plays offline.

## What runs where

| Part | Runs on |
| --- | --- |
| `main-site/`, the PWA and its leaderboard API (`main-site/api/`) | Vercel, root directory `main-site` |
| Database, `connect4_*` tables | The shared uwuapps Supabase project |
| Network games | Browser to browser over WebRTC. PeerJS's public broker introduces the two devices; nothing of ours is in between |

There is nothing on the VPS.

## Layout

```text
README.md
migrations/      SQL to run in the Supabase SQL editor, in number order
scripts/         pre-deploy checks and the engine tests
main-site/       the site Vercel deploys, including api/
```

The `uwuapps-*.md`, `update-bar-spec.md` and `STUN-p2p-spec.md` files at the
root are the specs this is built to. `main-site/README.md` covers the app
itself: the modes, scoring, anti-cheat, network games and the API.

## First setup

1. Run every file in `migrations/`, in number order, in the Supabase SQL
   editor of the shared uwuapps project. Each is safe to run again. Never
   edit one that has been run; a change is a new numbered file.
2. On the Vercel project (root directory `main-site`), set the variables in
   `main-site/.env.example`: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.
3. Add the domain `connect4.uwuapps.org` to the Vercel project.
4. Deploy.

Without the variables the site still works in full; the API answers
`not_configured` and every game says it is not scored.

## Before every deploy

1. Bump `VERSION` in `main-site/sw.js`. Without it, returning visitors keep
   the previous build and never see the update bar.
2. Run the checks, from the repo root, with Node 20 or later and nothing to
   install:

```text
node scripts/check-sw.mjs          # the worker only activates when asked
node scripts/check-precache.mjs    # everything the app loads works offline
node scripts/check-theme.mjs       # pre-paint script matches js/theme.js
node scripts/test-engine.mjs       # rules, seeds, the computer, scoring
node scripts/test-verify.mjs       # the API's game check, without a database
```

**If you change `main-site/js/engine.js`,** games played on the old build stop
verifying: the API replays every game with the code it has now, and a changed
computer or score makes an open tab's game fail the check. Deploy such changes
when a few refused submissions from open tabs are acceptable.
